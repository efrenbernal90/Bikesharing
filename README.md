Trips peak between the hours of 8AM-10AM and 5PM-8PM.

Thursdays have the most active hours compared to other weekdays, bu the weekends have longer periods of more prolonged activity.

Trips peaked at similar times for male and female genders. Males took more trips throughout the week.

When comparing subscriber to customer users, subscribers participated more often. Males participated more than any other gender.

## Summary 

These analysis show that majority who participated in the bikeshare program during the month of August 2009 were male subscribers, typically on Thursday evenings. 224,566 bikes used in the 5PM hour.  While Thursday was the most popular weekday among all gender groups, males favored it over females. In general, females are not as paricipatory while checking out, using, or returning the bikes.

A more targeted analysis could help increase female user participation in the bikeshare program. We can use these data to further explore female-specific metrics, such as amount of female users, ride counts, trip durations, age groups, etc.
